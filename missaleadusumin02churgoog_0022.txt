Resides which are inserted in a different hand, “ Festum de Nomine
J esu,'’ the Mass for St. David as given above, for the Dedication
of a Oburch, and for the Purification with the “Benedictio

luminis.'’

Tbere is therefore amply sufficient to determine the Use, which
clearly is Sarum pure and simple, with only the addition of special ,
office for S. David, just as the “Ripon Use'' seems to bave oon· '
sisted simply of the Yerk, with an office for St. Wilfrid, or as
probably almost every Ohurch had a special form for the Feast of
the Saint to whom it was dedicated.

Al PP· 61 and 62 oerso the MS. declares its “ Use ''—

Notaadom cst quod ia isto praefatione nunquam dicator, Per beatos
Evangelistas secusdum usuro Sarisburicasis Ecclesicc; and

I to asca quod ocssws praefationes totius cani sub hoc toao dicuntur,
eloe prsopw’sc habeantur sive aoso, tam ia Feriis qaum ia Fertis secuudum
assurt mum.

The Mass for the Dedication of the Ohurch, which includes the
Sequence and the Blessing of Tapers in the Purification, which are
added in the same hand as the Mass for S. David, are identical
with the Sarum Form. ·

The same is the case with the Canon, which-has a considerable
amount of rubrio.
