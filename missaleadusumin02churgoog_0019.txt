THE Usu OF S. ASAPH (?).
In the (lathedral Library at Hereford is a Mannal, which has

’ boen most kindly lent tc me hythe Dean and Chapter, which once

belonged to a Ohurch in Wales.

lhe MS. is of the middle of the loth Oentury. The name of
the Ohurch to which it belonged is repeatedly given on the fly-
leaves as “Llan Vair Keric Kadrarum’' or “Rodanum” or
“y Kadarum.'' On the ily-leaves at the beginning and end are
extracts of the proceedings of Courts held at Strad and Glyn.
lhere is also written on the ily-leaf at the end :—-

In Dei nomine, Amen, Ego Thomas ap J evan Gr. condo testa·
m(entum) in hunc modum: imprimis commend(o) animam meam Deo
omnipotenti (et corpus) meum ad sepeliendum in Ecclesia beatae Mariae

et sancti Kinec (l) . . . et ult(erius).

There is some difficulty in identifying Llan Vair Keric
Kadarum. ’

“ Keric '² appears clearly to be “ Oerrig'’-the stones, probably
boundary or memorial. Two suggestions have been made as to
the place intended-

1. That the namo is a corruption of Llan-fcir Caereinion or
Llanfair-yn-anreinicn in Montgomeryshire, near Welshpool,
which, in a map of North Wales, in Gibson's “Oamden,'' pub·
lished 1695, is spelt Llanvaier lnkrenion.

2. That Llan-fair-yn-Oedewaen‚ or as it is spelt in the map
above referred to, Llanfair-yn-Kidriorn‚ is intended. This name
has been superseded by tho English “ Newtown.'’

“trad” for “ Ystrad‚'’ i.e., stratum, street, and “ Glyn,'’ are too
common as Welsh names to give any precise indication.

The name S. Kinec, of which only the last letter is doubtful,
and which may have been written “Kinecii'' or “Kineciae‚'' as
two letters are missing, appears to represent St. Keyna, (leneu, or
Keyn3 but Ioannot find any church dedicated to st. Mary and
St. Keyn.

That the book was of Welsh Use is also shown by the Mass
for St. David, which I subjoin :-
