PREFAOE.

——--——-

Ir does not seem necessary to add anything to what has been
already said in the Prefaoe to the first Volume in regard to the
Missel of the York Usa. A few remarks only seem requisito as to
some of the Documenta printed in the AppendiX, principally with
regard to the Uses of Linooln and Bangor.

ΟΝ THE Usa OF LINOOLN.

‘Aaronom No. VI. is the fragment of aMissal of the Linooln
Use, from a MS. of the loth Century in the Bodleian Library.

The fragment consists of tho Offioes from the First Sunday in
Advent to the Wednesday following the Third Sunday.

The¹ question is, whether the Linooln Usa, as spoken of here
and in the Prefaoe to the English Prayer Book, was a distinet Use'
in the sense in whioh the Sarum, York, and Hereford were, or only

a variation from one or other of these Uses.

The following table of differenoes between this Fragment and
the corresponding portion of the three great Uses appears to prove

that the Linooln Use was no mere variation, but a distinct Use in ·

the full sense of the term :-
