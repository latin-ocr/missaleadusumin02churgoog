These variations would be abundantly sufficient 10 1011 any MS.

1111101 01 unknown Use, which gave the Sequcnces and the Ferial
Epistles and Gospels. Where these are not given, 1110 only test

left 11 the Verso 01101 the Alleluya on the Second Sunday, in which

Verse the York and Lincoln agree.

This 1s notan unimportant difference, though 01 would not at
all follow that ta Missal w1t 'th this Verse must tbe either 01 the York

01 Lincoln 1110. It rs found m the second portion 01 tho
York Missal, belonging to the Vioar of Leeds, which is described
Vol. i. pp. 11,-1., and which portion is very possibly of Lincoln
use3 it certainly is not that' of York, Sarum, or Hereford

Another test may possibly be found in a case where the
Calendar exists, by the date 01 the Feast of Relios, 0110101111-
coln, 01 will be seen below, p. 272, was kept at Lincoln on 1 uly 14,
though it is possible that the same day may be intended as in the
Sarum and Hereford Missals, where the Feast is entered for the
Sunday following the 8th 01 J uly. It seems hardly possible, there-
fore, 10 determine a MS. 1111101 10 110 Lincoln Use, until one with
the Ferial Epistles and Gospels and the Sequenoes agreeing with
the Fragment hasbeen discovered.

’1110 matter might be left here, but there are two MSS. which .
appear, or at least have appeared, to prove that the Lincoln Use
was only a uariatior of the Sarum, and only called a Use in the
same sense 01 the Ripon Use is spoken of.

These are in the Pontifioal in the University Library Ι01 (10111-

Itis given in the Printed Oatalogue of the Gambridge MSS, from
the arms emblazoned in the illuminated borders, as that of John
Russell, Bishop 01 Lincoln, 1480-1494, and is cited as such in the
notes to the “ Translation of the Sarum MissaF' There is no doubt
that the Use 01 110 Diocese, sor the Bishop of which this volume was
written, was Sarum. But it appears on further examination that
the arms are not those of Bishop Russell3* and a Ms‘ 1-11011110
