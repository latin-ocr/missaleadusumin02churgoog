Secondly, there isa volume in the British Muscam, Additional
Mss, 21, 974, which appears by the arms emblazoned on two
leaves to have belonged to John Longlaud, Bishop of Linooln,
1520-1547, and whichI have quoted as giving the Linooln Oolours,
Vol. i. p. xxi.

The volume contains the variations to be made at Pontifical
celebration of the Mass, and the Benedictions of Archbishop
Peckham. ’ The Use of the (lhurch for which this volume was
written was the Sarum. There seems no doubt that these arms
are those of Bishop Longland, and the only explanation I can
suggestis, either that this volume was copied from one belonging
to the Bishop of a Diooese whose Use really was Sarum, without
proper adaptation to the Diooese in which it was to be used, or that,
in the beginning of the l6th Century, the Sarum Use either had
been or was intended to be adopted in the Diooese of Linooln.
