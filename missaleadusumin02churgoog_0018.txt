Prosaca xiii

:arc assumed to do so in this case, it will be found, I think, on com-
paring the Oanon of the Mass, and the several Masses given in the
Appendix with the Sarum Missal, that there are scarcely sufficient
differences to indicate even a variation from the Sarum Use. The

same must be said of the Offioes for Baptism and Matrimony„ Ι

But these two are mere summaries. They will be given at length
in the Appendix to the York Manual, shortly to be printed by the
surtees Society.

The Office for the Burial of the Dead is peculiar and long.
, It will be given in the same volume.
There romain, as given in the Appendix‚ the Formo-—

1. For Blessing Oandles at the Purification
2. For Penitents on Aah Wednesday.

3. For Blessing Palms on Palm Sunday.
4. For Blessing Fire in Holy Week.

5. For Reconciliug Ponitents on Holy Thursday.

'These vary very considerable from the Printed Sarum MissaL but
they are ideatt'cul with the Forms found in the Pontificals of the
luth Oentury, which, for reasons lhave stated in the Preface to
the Surtees Edition of the “Pontifical of Archbishop Bainbridge‚'’
I believe to have given the original arrangement cf Bishop Osmund.

As to the Masses given in the Pontifical, the only variations
from the Sarum are-

1. In the Postcommuuion of the Mass “Pro Sacerdote et Episcopo.’'
2. In the Secret of that “Pro Sacerdote.’'
3. In tho Postoommunion of that “Pro vivis et Defunctis.’'

The List of Saints' Days for which Episcopal Benedictions are
given is very peculiar, including those of the Founders of the great
Orders·St. Francis (Day and Translation), st. Dominio, St. Olair,
and St. Bernard Of these the Feast of st. Francis only is found
in the Calendars of the Three Missals.

I feel strongly inclined cn the whole to the conclusion that this

Pontifical was compiled, cr rather copied from one compiled, without
¹any reference to the Use of Bangor. ’
