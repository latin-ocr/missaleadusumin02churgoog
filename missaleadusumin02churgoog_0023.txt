The only difference of any importance in the Earlier Offices in
the Volume is in the Servios ior Matrimony, “Vir autern stet a
sinistris mulieris et mulier a dextris viri,'' as in the Hereford
Form, and the “Manda Deus'' and Preces precede the giving of
the ring.

The forms of betrothal are-

Ieh N. take the N. to my' weddid wyf, for fayrore for soulers, for
ricchere for parer, for betere for were, in siknesse and in helthe, forte
deth us departe‚ and only to the holda, and tharto ich plyztte my* trenthe.

Ich N. tal( ye N. to my‘ wedded husbond, for fayrore for foulore‚ for
richer for porer, for beter for wera, in siknes and in helthe, to be boner
and buxeum in bedde and at bord and only to ye holde, forte deth us
deporto, and ther to ich plitte the my trouye.

Wyth this gold ryng y' ye wedde: gold and siluer ich ye geue, and
with my bodi ich ye worschep ; and with al my wordely'ch catel Ι ye
honours.

An exact collation of these Offices will be given in the Appen·
dix to the Edition of the “ York Manual.''

Arrnnnrx IV. contains a collection of what are there called

Proses, the Sequences of a later date, from a Troper in the
Bodleian Library, written sometime during the reign of Etheldred‚
and later than the Canonization of S. Ethelwold.

This is certainly the earliest known collection of Sequenoes:
fifty-five of thern do not appear in any printed collection to which
I have had access.

This MS. is the only English Troper known to exist. There
was once an English Troper in the Ohurch of S. Bavon at Ghent.
This is described by Pamelius in his “ Liturgicon‚'' and a few
Tropesaragiven. The MS. cannot now be found. It does not appear
to have contained any Sequences. The Bodleian MS. is described by
Mr. Maskell, “Ritualia Ecclesiae Anglicanee,'' vol. i. pp. xxxin-xli,
and very fully by Dr. Book, “Ohurch of our Fathers‚’' vol iii.
part ii. 20-28.

I have printed the Proses from this volume, as the earliest
collection of those used in the Ohurch oi England, and also as there
appears good reason for believing with Dr. Roek that a large
portion at least of these Proses were written by Alcuin.
